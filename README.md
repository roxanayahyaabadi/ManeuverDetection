# Driving Maneuver Detection
This repository hosts implementations for the "From Wheels to AI: Advanced Driving Maneuver Detection Through Active Learning Employing Vehicle Dynamics" paper, detecting driving maneuvers using rule-based and machine-learning approaches. It aims to enhance vehicle safety and intelligence by accurately identifying driving behaviors, combining traditional and modern techniques for comprehensive analysis.
