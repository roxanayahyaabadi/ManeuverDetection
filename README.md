# Driving Maneuver Detection
This repository hosts implementations for the "From Wheels to AI: Advanced Driving Maneuver Detection Through Active Learning Employing Vehicle Dynamics" paper, detecting driving maneuvers using rule-based and machine-learning approaches. It aims to enhance vehicle safety and intelligence by accurately identifying driving behaviors, combining traditional and modern techniques for comprehensive analysis.

# Dynamic Signals
We proposed to use some informative dynamic signals to detect the maneuver. 
The dataset used in this project can be found in the `Src/Feature_Vector_initial.csv` file.

# Rule-based Maneuver Detection

# Steering Wheel Angle Detection
The `Src/Steerinwhellangledetection.csv` file shows how to detect the relative Steering Wheel angle using decoding the ArUco marker stuck on the steering wheel.
